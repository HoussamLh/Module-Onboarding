      <h1>What is a Wireframe</h1>
      <p class="description">
        A <strong>wireframe</strong> is a visual representation of a user
        interface, often used in the early stages of design to outline the
        structure and layout of a website or application.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>wireframe</strong> serves as a visual guide that represents
          the skeletal framework of a website or application. The primary
          purpose of a <strong>wireframe</strong> is to establish the basic
          structure and layout before visual design and content are added.
        </p>
        <p>
          It acts as a blueprint, outlining the placement of elements like
          headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and navigation. Wireframes help
          designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize the user experience
          and identify potential issues early.

          <h2>What is the README File?</h2>
          <p>
            A <strong>README</strong> file is a text file that contains
            information about a project. It is typically included in the root
            directory and helps users understand the project quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>README</strong> files help users understand what a project
            is about, how it works, and how to use it. They are often the first
            file a developer or user will open when accessing a project.

            specific commit. It enables isolated development and collaboration.
            The default branch is usually <strong>master</strong>.
