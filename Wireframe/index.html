        <h4> What is the purpose of a <strong>wireframe?</strong> </h4>
        <p id="wireframe-purpose">
          A <strong>wireframe</strong> serves as a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application.
          The primary purpose of a <strong>wireframe</strong> is to establish the basic structure and layout of a website 
          or application before visual design and content are added. It acts as a blueprint, outlining the 
          placement of elements like headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and navigation. Wireframes help designers, developers, 
          and stakeholders visualize the user experience and identify potential issues early in the project.

        <h4>What is a branch in Git?</h4>
        <p class="git-branch">
        A <strong>branch</strong> in Git is a pointer to a specific <br>
        commit in the repository's history. When you create a new branch,<br>
        you're essentially creating a new line of development that diverges<br>
        from the main line (usually the master branch).A branch in<br>
        <strong>Git</strong> is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one <br>
        of these commits.The default branch name in Git is <strong>master</strong>. As you <br>
        start making commits, you'regiven a master branch that points to the last commit you made. <br>
        Every time you commit,the master branch pointer moves forward automatically. Note.<br>
